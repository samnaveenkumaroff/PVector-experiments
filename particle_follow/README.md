## üìÅ `particle_follow` ‚Äì Experiment 1

### üéØ Description

A simple yet elegant **particle-following system** implemented in **Processing (Python Mode)** using `PVector`. The particle smoothly follows the mouse cursor, leaving behind a glowing purple trail.

This experiment demonstrates:

* Vector-based motion (position, velocity, acceleration)
* Direction normalization and velocity limiting
* Smooth trail using transparent background
* Aesthetic glow and motion feel

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* **Processing IDE** ([Download here](https://processing.org/download/))
* **Python Mode** installed via Processing ‚Üí `Tools > Add Mode`

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open Processing IDE.
2. Switch to **Python Mode** (top-right dropdown).
3. Open `particle_follow/particle_follow.pyde`.
4. Click **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚Äî then move your mouse around to see the particle follow!
