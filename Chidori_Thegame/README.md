# Chidori\_thegame ⚡

*A cinematic anime-inspired Chidori attack game built with Processing (Python Mode)*

## 🎮 Game Description

**Chidori\_thegame** is a visual and interactive anime-style fighting experience inspired by iconic shinobi moves. Charge your Chidori, dash across the screen, and strike your enemy in an electrifying final blow.

Created entirely in one `Chidori.pde` file using **Processing (Python Mode)**, this project features:

* ⚡ Dynamic Chidori charge & lightning effects
* 🌀 Smooth particle trails and camera shake
* 🌸 Animated sakura petals and layered mountains
* 🎯 Mouse-controlled targeting and fluid enemy knockback
* 🏯 Atmospheric traditional Japanese scenery

## 🧠 Built with Vectors

This game was built as part of a learning journey using **`PVector`**—Processing's 2D vector class.
All motion, physics, targeting, and particle effects are powered by vector math:

* Character and enemy positioning with `PVector`
* Chidori movement and follow behavior using vector interpolation
* Final blow direction and knockback calculated via vector subtraction and normalization
* Lightning arcs and particle directions based on randomized vectors

This project helped reinforce key vector programming concepts like:

* Direction and magnitude
* Normalization and scaling
* Vector subtraction for displacement
* Linear interpolation (`lerp`) for smooth transitions

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Click** anywhere on the canvas to place your Shinobi opponent.
2. Press **`SPACE`** to charge your Chidori.
3. After \~2 seconds, your Chidori becomes active.
4. **Move your mouse** to control the Chidori and strike the opponent.
5. Watch the effects—camera shake, health drop, and a final flying blow if successful!

## 🎨 Visual Highlights

* **Twilight Gradient Background** with mountains, stars, mist, and traditional architecture
* **Custom UI**: animated health bars, attack indicators, and crosshairs
* **Energy Ball** and **Lightning Effects** that evolve during charging and attack
* **Final Blow Animation**: enemy flies off-screen with gravity and rotation
