# 🌀 PVector Experiments

A curated collection of creative simulations and generative AI explorations using `PVector` in **Processing (Python Mode)**.

This repository showcases my journey through **vector mathematics**, **particle systems**, and **autonomous motion**, laying the foundation for deeper experiments in **Generative AI**, **creative coding**, and **interactive systems**.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder or sketch represents a unique visual or behavior-driven experiment:

| Sketch Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ChidoriFollow` | Inspired by anime-style effects: a particle charges up, follows the mouse, and attacks a character with visual feedback. |
| `RandomWalker` | Simple random walker using PVectors for controlled wandering. |
| `GravityMotion` | Demonstrates PVector-based gravitational pull between objects. |
| `MouseAttractRepel` | A particle that is attracted to or repelled from the mouse using vector forces. |
| `ChidoriFighter` | Advanced version of ChidoriFollow with states (placing, charging, attacking) and camera effects. |
| `FlowField (coming soon)` | Flow-field-driven particles using Perlin noise to simulate wind-like or generative AI motion. |

## 🧠 Why PVector?

`PVector` is a foundational class in Processing for 2D/3D vector manipulation. Mastering it enables:

- Realistic motion (acceleration, velocity)
- Force simulations (gravity, friction, wind)
- Autonomous behaviors (seeking, fleeing, wandering)
- Generative visuals driven by simple rules and math
